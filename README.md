# Reproducibility in an Office World

[Slides](2019-05-11-rstatsnyc-redoc-talk.pdf) and examples from a talk given at the [New York R Conference](http://rstats.nyc/) meetup on 2019-05-11, introducing the [**redoc**](https://noamross.github.io/redoc/) package.  The slides are pretty
sparse, as I mostly spoke without notes and live-coded, but video will be up
soon.
