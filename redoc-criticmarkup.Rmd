**redoc** supports [Critic Markup](http://criticmarkup.com/users-guide.php)
syntax for comments.  

You can {++ include ++} edits and they will be converted
to {~~ tacked ~> tracked ~~} changes in your {== Word document ==}{>> Neat! <<}.

By default {-- default --}, your system username is used as the author of
changes, but this can be set with the `comment_author` argument in `redoc()`
or your document YAML.
